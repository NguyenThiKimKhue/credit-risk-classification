# credit-risk-classification

## Overview

This project aims to analyze credit risk by building a logistic regression model to predict loan defaults based on historical lending data. The analysis focuses on assessing the health of loans and identifying high-risk loans to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

1. [Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets](#split-the-data-into-training-and-testing-sets)
